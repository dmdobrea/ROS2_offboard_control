# A ROS2 application designed for the offboard control of a PX4 UAV
## Overview
This tutorial explains how to integrate **ROS2** and **PX4** to control a simulated **UAV** using velocity. An **XBOX** controller is used for user controls. The **UAV** system is simulated with either **Gazebo** or **JMAVSim**.
The primary objective is to develop a **Python** example that anyone can follow, understand, and utilize comprehensively, based on **ROS2** and **PX4**.
